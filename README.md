# ❤️🧠 Heart Stroke Classification | Machine Learning Project 🤖
This is a Heart Stroke Classification System built using machine learning algorithms 🤖 to predict the likelihood of a person experiencing a stroke 🧠 based on health-related factors 🩺. The system analyzes patient medical data 📋 and lifestyle attributes 🏃‍♂️🍽️ to assist in early detection ⏰ and preventive care 🛡️.

The project focuses on classification techniques 📊 to categorize patients as either at risk ⚠️ or not at risk ✅ for a stroke, improving clinical decision-making 🏥 and prioritizing timely intervention 🚑.
